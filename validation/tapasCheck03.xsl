  <!-- This is a dummy test that never returns any errors or warnings. -->

  <!-- so that the TAPAS Drupal/PHP code can be written to call an XML -->
  <!-- test that has not yet been written. (Thus, whenever the test is -->
  <!-- created, it is very easy to plug it into the Drupal system: it  -->
  <!-- just has to replace this file.)                                 -->

  <!-- After all, it's pretty hard to assert copyright (the basis of   -->
  <!-- copyleft) on only one line of code. And BTW, the only reason    -->
  <!-- that one line is present is because some processors choke       -->
  <!-- on just <xsl:stylesheet/>, even though AFAIK the spec permits   -->
